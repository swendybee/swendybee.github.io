<h2>Teaching a dog to skate board</h2>
<p>Put the side of a big cardboard box on four even stacks of books. Lure the dog on with a treat. If it dosent get on right
	away, practice some more. Then put the skateboard on the sidewalk. Lure the dog on with a treat. Give the skateboard a little
	push, and we're off!
	<h2>Fetch</h2>
	<p>Throw a ball. The dog doesn't know to bring back the ball, so hold up a treat. If it doesen't bring the ball, keep throwing
		the ball. Soon youll be having a fetchin time!

		<p>If you don't want to train it, you can go to a dog trainer.
