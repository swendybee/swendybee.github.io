    <p>lets start with a basic command, sit. get a few treats. then get your dog. say "SIT" and push on the part right before the tail. your dog should plop down. practice it untill the dog is good at it.</p>

    ">
    <p>You dont have to say down for this one. you can say whatever you want. get your dog to sit. then put a treat near its nose. the dog should lunge for it.pull it to the ground. then the dogs should follow it. what dog would resist a tasty treat? drag
        the treat along the ground. if the dog stands up, start over. if he/she lays down, give them the treat. do this for a bit, then start saying "Down" or whatever you make it. </p>
    <h1>TOUCH</h1>

    <p>put out your hand. put a treat in your hand and make your hand into a fist. say "Touch" and if the dog sniffs or licks your hand, give it a treat. keep doing this.</p>
    <h1>LOOK</h1>

    <h1>Congratulations! You have mastered all the basic commands. Here is some fun games and commands for you and your dog to play with!</h1><img src="celebrate.JPG" alt="trumpet coffeti celebration" width="160">
    <h3>SKATEBOARD!!!</h3>
    <p>this is my favorite! get a plank of wood. lay it across 2 stacks of books. after that, get your dog and ALOT of treats. get teh dog to at least put its front paws on the board. soon it wil be on the board fully. after that, get out the skateboard.
        heres the BEST part! get your dog on the skate board. make it sit. if your dog is big enough, put on a helmet for teh dog. saftey first!then just steer it around the drive way. the push down the sidewalk or street, and doggie blast off!</p>
    <h3>HIDE AND... TREAT?</h3>
    <p> OK,OK the name is kinda weird.get a friend or family member to hold the doggies leash. then hide! call out " (your dogs name) "the person holding the leash will let go. the dog will find you, just keep calling out! Then use treats as a trail, then
        just play normal hide and seek, with a treat in your hand, so you're playing Hide and Treat!</p>
